Fluorescent sensors developed based on nano-materials have penetrated into cancer medical sensing research due to their unique properties, such as high sensitivity, high specificity. The number of cancer patients has continued to rise in recent years, and the limitations of traditional cancer diagnosis methods can no longer meet the demand for accurate early cancer screening. Accurate identification of cancer bio-macromolecular markers can significantly improve early diagnosis and follow-up treatment. To this end, we provide an overview of the properties and uses of different nano-materials and detail the principles and functions of fluorescent nano-biosensor detection for different cancer bio-macromolecular markers. In addition, the prospects and challenges of translating this convenient and visual diagnostic method into the clinical application are discussed.
